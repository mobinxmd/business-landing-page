The business landing page project is a website design and development project that aims to create a professional and engaging online presence for a business. The landing page serves as the primary entry point for potential customers and provides a clear call-to-action to encourage engagement with the business.

The project utilizes various technologies to create an engaging and responsive website. HTML is used to structure the content of the page and provide a solid foundation for the design. CSS is used to style the page and make it visually appealing, while also ensuring that it is optimized for different screen sizes and devices. Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, is used to enhance the design and functionality of the page, providing a responsive grid system and pre-built components that streamline the development process. Together, these technologies help to create a modern and professional landing page that effectively showcases the business and encourages customer engagement.
